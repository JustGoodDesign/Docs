###ADB Sub Menu###

The ADB gives you access to GUI that wraps the Android Debugger. Set the Android SDK path and then the menu can update to the latest adb. With adb you can start/stop the adb server and open an interactive shell. Open the ADB help for the full list of adb options.

###Split Sub Menu###

By default, the Good Drop panel opens with the split option off. This causes the files and devices sections to display in tabs.

Selecting the split option will cause the files and devices sections to display in the same panel.
